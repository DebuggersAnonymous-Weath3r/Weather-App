        <!-- The problem I'm having is that I'm not being able to access the style.css to my understanding because the 
        file is outside of this directory we have to go back one directory with '..' and then search for it with '/style.css'
        Dont know why is not working it has to be that I'm missing something but I did search on the internet and didn't find
        a way to solve it. Am I missing something? Ps. Same is happening with adding the logo inside of the 'home.html' template. Line 14 of home.html -->
